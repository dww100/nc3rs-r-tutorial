# NC3Rs David Sainsbury Fellows Meeting: R Tutorial

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the *R* statistical modelling and graphing environment.
The basic goal is to demonstrate that scripting and analysis in a programming language like *R* is vastly superior to using spreadsheets (such as Excel).
No assumptions are made about previous programming experience.

## Learning objectives

After completing this tutorial you should:

* be familiar with basic *R* commands and *R Studio*
* be able to import, explore and manipulate your data in *R*
* know how and where to get help and documentation
* be capable of creating and modifying simple *R* scripts
* seen how to create a beautiful plot using *ggplot2*

## Prerequisites

To follow this course you need to have installed *R* and *R Studio* on your laptop.
If you haven't already done so they can be downloaded (for free) from the links below:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
